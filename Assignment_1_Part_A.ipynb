    "In this section you will be create some simple user-defined functions for the robot. No imports are needed to complete these questions - they can be solved with base Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we will represent position vectors in Python as 2-element tuples. For example, the tuple <code>(5, 2)</code> would represent the position 5 units along the x-axis and 2 units up the y-axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important note about Python tuples is that mathematical operators aren't supported. For example, <code>(3, 1) + (0, 1)</code> will not result in the tuple <code>(3, 2)</code>. To operate on the position tuples we will need to create our own user-defined functions. The examples in 1.1 and 1.2 serve as a guide on the basic principles on tuples and user-defined functions that are required to complete Part A."
