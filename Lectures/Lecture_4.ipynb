    "## While Loops\n",
    "A while loop will continue to iterate through a block of code while its corresponding expression is true. They are useful when the number of iterations is conditional (as opposed to pre-determined like a for loop). This makes them particularly useful for numerical methods, which iterate until the solution converges or reaches a certain degree of accuracy.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "while logical_expression:\n",
    "    while_loop_body\n",
    "```\n",
    "where the `logical_expression` is an expression that compares values and returns `True` or `False` (you used these in if statements!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some caution must be taken with while loops. If the logical expression always returns true, the while loop will iterate infinitely."
