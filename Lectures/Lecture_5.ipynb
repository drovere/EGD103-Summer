    "## Strings\n",
    "Strings are a sequence of characters used to form a piece of text. You can create a string with single quotes 'example string' or double quotes \"another example string\". A multi-line quote is created by using three quotes.\n",
    "* Since they are a sequence type, you can apply sequence operations, index, slice, and iterate through each character with a for loop\n",
    "* String methods allow for text to be processed easily\n",
    "* Can use the input function to ask the user for an input\n",
    "* Can use a formatted string to clearly communicate messages to the user\n",
    "\n",

    "An array is a data type that represents a collection of data in a structured format. They are similar to lists except:\n",
    "* All elements of an array must be of the same data type.\n",
    "* Arrays can be n-dimensional. For example, a 2-dimensional array would have rows and columns.\n",

    "* Access to element-wise operators\n",

    "* Access to functions and methods for statistics\n",
    "* Access to functions, methods and operators for linear algebra (vectors and matrices)\n",
